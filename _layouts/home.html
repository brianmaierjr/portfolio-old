			<h2>A digital craftsmen, eh?</h2>
			<br />
			<p>It's true. I am able to craft amazing creations digitally using many tools that I have discoverd throughout the past 5 years. If you would like to see some examples you can <a href="mailto:brimaidesigns@gmail.com">email me</a> or check out what I am working on now <a href="#dribbble">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Historically I have been known to create things with my hands using paint, ink, chalk, and pencil. I like to take what I have learned with my hands and transfer that into my digital designs.</p>
