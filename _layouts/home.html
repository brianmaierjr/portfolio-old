 		Hello, I'm Brian! I'm a designer/front-end developer that adheres to simplicity and usability. I'm a sucker for hand-lettering, typography and long walks on the beach.

			I am able to craft amazing creations digitally using the many tricks and tools that I have discovered throughout the past 5+ years designing. If you would like to see some more work you can <a href="mailto:brimaidesigns@gmail.com">email me</a> or check out some work in progress below.
