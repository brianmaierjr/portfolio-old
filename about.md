<h1>Brian Maier Jr.</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Idiot Extraordinaire</p>


In my 5+ years I've had my hand in many different projects ranging from web apps, mobile app, websites, branding, front-end development, video production, illustration and more. I strive to keep the user in the forefront and to always keep learning.

## What I've Done

* Worked on projects for P&G, Big Ass Fans and Walmart and more
* Presented at WordCamp on the topic of Responsive Design.
* Was featured on dozens of design blogs and galleries.
* Created tools that are used by thousands of other designers.
* Helped multiple startups gain traction and receive funding from various sources.

## Side Projects

I always have a side project or two in the works. It keeps me on my toes and allows me to experiment with new techniques and technologies. Here are a few that have survived throught the years.

### [147 Colors](http://147colors.com/ "147 Colors")<br/>
147 Colors is a tool built to help web designers and developers learn the 147 CSS color names that are available today. It is a tool that is used by thousands of people all over the world.
*Currently in development:* Photoshop plugin for the 147 Colors

### [Loutography](http://loutography.com/ "Loutography")<br/>
I love taking photos, and now that I have a camera in my pocket at all times I decided to showcase some of them. Loutography is a photo exploration of the wonderful city of Louisville, Kentucky where I currently reside.
