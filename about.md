## Brian Maier Jr.
*Idiot Extraordinaire*

With over 5 years experience I have had my hand in many different projects ranging from web/mobile apps & websites, branding, front-end development, video production, illustration and more. I strive to keep the user in the forefront and to always keep learning.

### What I've Done

* Presented at WordCamp on the topic of Responsive Design.
* Was featured on dozens of design blogs and galleries.
* Created tools that are used by thousands of other designers.
* Helped multiple startups gain traction and receive funding from various sources.

### Side Projects

I always have a side project or two in the works. It keeps me on my toes and allows me to experiment with new techniques and technologies. Here are a few that have survived throught the years.

**[147 Colors](http://147colors.com/ "147 Colors")**<br/>
147 Colors is a tool built to help web designers and developers learn the 147 CSS color names that are available today. It is a tool that is used by thousands of people all over the world.
*Currently in development:* Photoshop plugin for the 147 Colors

**[Loutography](http://loutography.com/ "Loutography")**<br/>
I love taking photos, and now that I have a camera in my pocket at all times I decided to showcase some of them. Loutography is a photo exploration of the wonderful city of Louisville, Kentucky where I currently reside.

#### About This Site

This is the fifth version of my website/portfolio. This time around I opted for a lightweight static generated site powered by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. All code was hand crafted in Sublime Text and compiled & minimized with Grunt.

Type was experimented with in Typecast and then provided by fonts.com. Body type is Nimrod and all headings are set in Univers. Icon font was created in Icomoon. Fittext & Lettering.js were used for optimal type control.
