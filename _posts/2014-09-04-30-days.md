Since launching my site 6 months ago I have only written two blog posts...

The entire point of me building my site out in Jekyll and using GitHub was for this purpose exactly. What can I say, finding the time to write has been much harder than I thought. Fortunately for me I follow Matt D. Smit who <a href="http://mattdsmith.com/30-day-blog-challenge">rececntly posted</a> about a 30 day blog challenge. He has chosen to accept the challenge and so have I.

Yesterday was my first post and today I sit here on my lunch break desperately attempting to churn out enough words to have a sufficient post.

I'm looking forward to finishing out these 30 days of blogging. If I grow the tiniest bit as a writer then it will prove to be successful.

Until tomorrow.
