A couple months ago I switched from designing at an Interactive agency to working for higher education focused organization not knowing what was going to happen. I'm here today saying I'm glad I took the leap.

<h2 class="h3">A brief history</h2>
For three years I designed many websites and apps for <a href="http://mindboxstudios.com" target="_blank">Mindbox Studios</a> in Cincinnati, Ohio. With the crew there we all learned plenty of valuable lessons about being a young company in a rapidly expanding industry. At Mindbox I was purely doing visual mockups and the urge to start developing sites was constantly growing. As the urge grew stronger I found <a href="http://dbswebsite.com" target="_blank">DBS Interactive</a>, an employer that was willing to teach me to code while taking advantage of my <a href="http://dribbble.com/brianmaierjr.com" target="_blank">ballin' ass design skills.</a>

So I moved to Louisville, Kentucky and for 3 years I designed and developed in a very fast, deadline-driven environment. That was plenty of time for me to realize that I didn't particularly care for the agency environment. I really wanted to focus more on our projects and hone in on what was and wasn't working. Instead we were constantly shipping out products and not doing any follow up. This frustration lead me to look for a job working for a company where I could sharpen my UX and development skills in a more comfortable environment.

In time I found <a href="http://learninghouse.com" target="_blank">The Learning House</a>. Here at Learning House we partner with Universities to develop online programs that get results. In my short time here I have had plenty of time to learn and research things I hadn't had the time to previously.

<h2 class="h3">The same but different</h2>
Don't get me wrong, we still have clients and deadlines but instead we are focused on results. We are not obtaining clients to knock out a quick site and get paid. We instead research and analyze every angle to get the best results we can. I love the pace of work here and even though I don't get to do off the wall creative projects I get to refine my skills and become a better rounded Front End Developer.

<h2 class="h3">Conclusion</h2>
If you are not happy with your current job take the time to analyze why and fix it. I was stuck for too long and growing more anxious and stressed by the day. Now I come in to work excited and ready to keep learning.
