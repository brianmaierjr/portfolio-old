Woah. I've finally finished this portfolio and I couldn't be happier.

I may have jumped the gun but I wanted to get it out and see what people think. There is still plenty of work to be done and by pushing it live I'm hoping to have it done sooner than later. Thanks to [this article](https://medium.com/p/f8083e76146d "Stop putting it off and accept the challenge.") I decided to just put up what I have and run with it. 

<h2 class="h3">The unofficial to-do list</h2>

* Test, test, and test more on multiple devices.
* Check for unused css/code
* Image optimization for mobile
* <s>Mess with fittext on homepage (still too small)</s>
* Customize sharing buttons
* <s>Add Disqus to posts</s>
* <s>Set up Vertical Rhythm</s>

If you notice anything else that is off or wonky please feel free to comment. Thanks for reading.
