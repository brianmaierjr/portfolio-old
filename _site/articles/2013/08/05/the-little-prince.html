<p>It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:</p>

<p>In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.”</p>

<p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p>

<p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>

<p>But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?”</p>

<p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.</p>
