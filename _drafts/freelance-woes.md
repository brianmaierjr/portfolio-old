I'm comfortably in my 3rd month at the new job and freelance work is the last thing on my mind.

This year I have tried as much as possible to focus on personal projects that will propel me and my career. I haven't done a lot but I also haven't had the constant weight of freelance on my back. The price for this stress free lifestyle has been rewarding to the extreme.

I am a single father that shares time with my son's mother so I have half the amount of freetime that a childless designer with a full time job has.
