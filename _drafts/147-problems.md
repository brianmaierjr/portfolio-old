I'm proud to introduce a new and extremely useful 147 Colors Photoshop CC Extension.

For those of you that don't know, I created a site documenting the 147 CSS Color names called [147 Colors](http://147colors.com "147 Colors"). Since it's launch it has gotten a great response from designers & developers around the world.

I pushed myself to think of what was next for 147 Colors (if anything) and this is what came from it. The other options was an iPhone app, which I still want to do.
