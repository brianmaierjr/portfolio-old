Woah. I've finally finished this portfolio and I couldn't be happier.

I may have jumped the gun but I wanted to get it out and see what people think. There is still plenty of work to be done and by pushing it live I'm hoping to have it done sooner than later.

<div class="example">

{% endhighlight %}
